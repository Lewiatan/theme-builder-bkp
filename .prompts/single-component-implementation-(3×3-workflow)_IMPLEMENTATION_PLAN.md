Your task is to implement a shared component based on the provided implementation plan. Your goal is to create a solid and well-organized implementation that includes appropriate validation, error handling, and follows all logical steps described in the plan.

First, carefully review the provided implementation plan:

<implementation_plan>
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN
</implementation_plan>

<implementation_approach>
Use "3x3 Workflow"
</implementation_approach>

Now perform the following steps to implement the REST API endpoint:

1. Analyze the implementation plan:
   - Define the necessary data
   - Determine the data that goes to the database
   - List all variants
   - Understand the required business logic and data processing stages
   - Note any special requirements for validation or error handling.

2. Begin implementation:
   - Start by creating the necessary directory and by creating types file.
   - Follow the logical steps described in the implementation plan
   - Implement all necessary validation
   - Implement error handling accordingly to the plan
   - Ensure proper data processing and transformation according to requirements

3. Validation and error handling:
   - Implement thorough validation as described in the plan
   - Provide clear and informative error messagess.
   - Handle potential exceptions that may occur during processing.

4. Testing considerations:
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues that should be tested.
   - Ensure the implementation covers all scenarios mentioned in the plan.

5. Documentation:
   - Add clear comments to explain complex logic or important decisions
   - Include documentation for the main function and any helper functions.

After completing the implementation, ensure it includes all necessary imports, function definitions, and any additional helper functions or classes required for the implementation.

If you need to make any assumptions or have any questions about the implementation plan, present them before writing code.

Remember to follow design and coding best practices, adhere to programming language style guidelines, and ensure the code is clean, readable, and well-organized.
